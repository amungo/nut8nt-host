Arasan NAND Flash Controller with ONFI 3.1 support

Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be "xlnx,zynqmp-nand", "arasan,nfc-v3p10"
- reg:			Memory map for module access
- interrupt-parent:	Interrupt controller the interrupt is routed through
- interrupts:		Should contain the interrupt for the device
- clock-name:		List of input clocks - "sys", "flash"
			(See clock bindings for details)
- clocks:		Clock phandles (see clock bindings for details)

Required properties for child node:
- nand-ecc-mode: see nand.txt

For NAND partition information please refer the below file
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mtd/partition.txt

Example:
	nfc: nand@ff100000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,zynqmp-nand", "arasan,nfc-v3p10"
		reg = <0x0 0xff100000 0x1000>;
		clock-name = "sys", "flash"
		clocks = <&misc_clk &misc_clk>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <0 14 4>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>

		nand@0 {
			reg = <0>
			nand-ecc-mode = "hw";
		};
	};
