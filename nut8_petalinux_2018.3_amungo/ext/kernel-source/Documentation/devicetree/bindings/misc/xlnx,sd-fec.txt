* Xilinx SDFEC(16nm) IP *

The Soft Decision Forward Error Correction (SDFEC) Engine is a Hard IP block
which provides high-throughput LDPC and Turbo Code implementations.
The LDPC decode & encode functionality is capable of covering a range of
customer specified Quasi-cyclic (QC) codes. The Turbo decode functionality
principally covers codes used by LTE. The FEC Engine offers significant
power and area savings versus implementations done in the FPGA fabric.


Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "xlnx,sd-fec-1.1‚Äù
- reg: Should contain Xilinx SDFEC 16nm Hardened IP block registers
  location and length.
- xlnx,sdfec-code : Should contain "ldpc" or "turbo" to describe the codes
  being used.
- xlnx,sdfec-din-words : A value 0 indicates that the DIN_WORDS interface is
  driven with a fixed value and is not present on the device, a value of 1
  configures the DIN_WORDS to be block based, while a value of 2 configures the
  DIN_WORDS input to be supplied for each AXI transaction.
- xlnx,sdfec-din-width : Configures the DIN AXI stream where a value of 1
  configures a width of "1x128b", 2 a width of "2x128b" and 4 configures a width
  of "4x128b".
- xlnx,sdfec-dout-words : A value 0 indicates that the DOUT_WORDS interface is
  driven with a fixed value and is not present on the device, a value of 1
  configures the DOUT_WORDS to be block based, while a value of 2 configures the
  DOUT_WORDS input to be supplied for each AXI transaction.
- xlnx,sdfec-dout-width : Configures the DOUT AXI stream where a value of 1
  configures a width of "1x128b", 2 a width of "2x128b" and 4 configures a width
  of "4x128b".
Optional properties:
- interrupts: should contain SDFEC interrupt number
