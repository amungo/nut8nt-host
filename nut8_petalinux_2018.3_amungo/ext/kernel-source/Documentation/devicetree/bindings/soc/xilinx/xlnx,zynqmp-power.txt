Xilinx Zynq MPSoC Power Management Device Tree Bindings

The zynqmp-power node describes the power management configurations.

Required properties:
 - compatible	: Should be one of
		  "xlnx,zynqmp-power"
		  "xlnx,zynqmp-pm" (deprecated)
 - mbox-names	: Name given to channels seen in the 'mboxes' property.
		  "rx" - Mailbox corresponding to receive path
		  "tx" - Mailbox corresponding to transmit path
 - mboxes	: Standard property to specify a Mailbox. Each value of
		  the mboxes property should contain a phandle to the
		  mailbox controller device node and an args specifier
		  that will be the phandle to the intended sub-mailbox
		  child node to be used for communication. See
		  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mailbox/mailbox.txt
		  for more details about the generic mailbox controller
		  and client driver bindings. Also see
		  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mailbox/ \
		  xlnx,zynqmp-ipi-mailbox.txt for typical controller that
		  is used to communicate with this System controllers.

Examples:
	zynqmp_power: zynqmp-power {
		compatible = "xlnx,zynqmp-power";
		mboxes = <&ipi_mailbox_pmu0 0>,
			 <&ipi_mailbox_pmu0 1>;
		mbox-names = "tx", "rx";
	};
