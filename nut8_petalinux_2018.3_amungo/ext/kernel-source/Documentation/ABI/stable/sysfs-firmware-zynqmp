What:		/sys/firmware/zynqmp/ggs*
Date:		January 2018
KernelVersion:	4.15.0
Contact:	"Jolly Shah" <jollys@xilinx.com>
Description:
		Read/Write PMU global general storage register value,
		GLOBAL_GEN_STORAGE{0:3}.
		Global general storage register that can be used
		by system to pass information between masters.

		The register is reset during system or power-on
		resets. Three registers are used by the FSBL and
		other Xilinx software products: GLOBAL_GEN_STORAGE{4:6}.

		Usage:
		# cat /sys/firmware/zynqmp/ggs0
		# echo <mask> <value> > /sys/firmware/zynqmp/ggs0

		Example:
		# cat /sys/firmware/zynqmp/ggs0
		# echo 0xFFFFFFFF 0x1234ABCD > /sys/firmware/zynqmp/ggs0

KernelVersion:	4.15.0
Contact:	"Jolly Shah" <jollys@xilinx.com>
Description:
		Read/Write PMU persistent global general storage register
		value, PERS_GLOB_GEN_STORAGE{0:3}.
		Persistent global general storage register that
		can be used by system to pass information between
		masters.

		This register is only reset by the power-on reset
		and maintains its value through a system reset.
		Four registers are used by the FSBL and other Xilinx
		software products: PERS_GLOB_GEN_STORAGE{4:7}.
		Register is reset only by a POR reset.

		Usage:
		# cat /sys/firmware/zynqmp/pggs0
		# echo <mask> <value> > /sys/firmware/zynqmp/pggs0

		Example:
		# cat /sys/firmware/zynqmp/pggs0
		# echo 0xFFFFFFFF 0x1234ABCD > /sys/firmware/zynqmp/pggs0

What:		/sys/firmware/zynqmp/shutdown_scope
Date:		February 2018
KernelVersion:	4.15.6
Contact:	"Jolly Shah" <jollys@xilinx.com>
Description:
		This sysfs interface allows to set the shutdown scope for the
		next shutdown request. When the next shutdown is performed, the
		platform specific portion of PSCI-system_off can use the chosen
		shutdown scope.

		Following are available shutdown scopes(subtypes):

		subsystem:	Only the APU along with all of its peripherals
				not used by other processing units will be
				shut down. This may result in the FPD power
				domain being shut down provided that no other
				processing unit uses FPD peripherals or DRAM.
		ps_only:	The complete PS will be shut down, including the
				RPU, PMU, etc.  Only the PL domain (FPGA)
				remains untouched.
		system:		The complete system/device is shut down.

		Usage:
		# cat /sys/firmware/zynqmp/shutdown_scope
		# echo <scope> > /sys/firmware/zynqmp/shutdown_scope

		Example:
		# cat /sys/firmware/zynqmp/shutdown_scope
		# echo "subsystem" > /sys/firmware/zynqmp/shutdown_scope

What:		/sys/firmware/zynqmp/health_status
Date:		April 2018
KernelVersion:	4.14.0
Contact:	"Rajan Vaja" <rajanv@xilinx.com>
Description:
		This sysfs interface allows to set the health status. If PMUFW
		is compiled with CHECK_HEALTHY_BOOT, it will check the healthy
		bit on FPD WDT expiration. If healthy bit is set by a user
		application running in Linux, PMUFW will do APU only restart. If
		healthy bit is not set during FPD WDT expiration, PMUFW will do
		system restart.

		Usage:
		Set healty bit
		# echo 1 > /sys/firmware/zynqmp/health_status

		Unset healty bit
		# echo 0 > /sys/firmware/zynqmp/health_status

Users:		Xilinx
